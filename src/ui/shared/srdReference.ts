/**
 * The rules the GM looks up by hand, selected out of the shipped dataset.
 *
 * Split from `ruleText.ts` on purpose. That file is the *reader* - which shape
 * a body arrived in - and this one is the *selector*: which section, which
 * table inside it, and what shape the screen wants it in. Neither imports
 * React and neither imports the store; both take `RulesSection[]` the way
 * `traitVerbs` already does, so a test can hand them a section it built by hand
 * and see the same code the screen runs.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to keep
 *
 * Every string these functions return came out of `data/srd-1.0.json` at
 * runtime. Not one rules sentence, table heading, row name or column name is
 * typed into this repository. `Manuali/` is gitignored precisely because that
 * wording belongs to Darrington Press, and an app that stamps `SRD 1.0 · P.73`
 * over text it typed itself is claiming a provenance it does not have - which
 * is the same defect as a screen reporting a save that never reached the disk,
 * pointed at a licence instead of at a disk.
 *
 * So the selectors below match on **section id** and on the SRD's own `## `
 * subheads, never on a row label, and they pivot tables by position within the
 * table they found. What they hand back is the dataset's wording, verbatim,
 * with its page number attached so the screen can say where it came from.
 *
 * ## A layer can replace any of this
 *
 * `rules` is in `dataset.ts`'s mergeable `COLLECTIONS`, so a homebrew layer can
 * rewrite a section outright. Every function here returns a named empty value
 * on a miss - the `NO_RULES` pattern `Conditions.tsx` uses - so a missing
 * section draws a blank panel instead of throwing. No row count is asserted
 * anywhere in `src`; the counts belong in the tests, against the shipped file.
